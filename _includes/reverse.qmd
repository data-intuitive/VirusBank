The reverse genetic system is mostly a plasmid-based system that can be used to insert the desired mutations in the viral genome to study the effect of these mutations on viral replication, virulence, sensitivity to antiviral compounds and etc in vitro and in vivo. Such systems can also be used to engineer viruses carrying reporter genes for development of high throughput antiviral assays or easily detection method for in vivo replication.
