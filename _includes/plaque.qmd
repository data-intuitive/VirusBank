This assay is a standard method to quantify infectious virus titers in a sample. Briefly, the test sample is serially diluted then aliquot of each dilution is added to a well in a cell culture plate with incubation to allow virus attachment followed by removal of the viral input and adding overlay of agarose or similar viscous material that limit the spread of viral infection. Under this condition, the attached virion will start to replicate producing more virions that will kill surrounding cells to generate a hole or plaque in the cell monolayer. By removal of the overlay and staining the live cells for e.g. by Crystal violet or methylene blue, this will provide a dark background for clear visualization of plaques. By counting the plaques at certain dilution(s), the plaque forming units (PFU)/mL can be calculated.
