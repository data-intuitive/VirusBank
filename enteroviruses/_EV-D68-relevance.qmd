This virus appears to have evolved only recently with the first known strain isolated in 1965. 

It was associated with an outbreak of neurological disease in the United States in 1969. 

It then spread to Europe with outbreaks there in Bulgaria (1975) and Hungary (1978). 

It has since spread to various countries in Asia (China, Japan, Taiwan, Cambodia and Vietnam) where it has been responsible for several very large epidemics.
