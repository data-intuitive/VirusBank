## Medical relevance

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
SFV was first isolated from in the Semliki Forest in 1942. The virus is found mainly in central, eastern, and southern Africa.

SFV is a useful research tool to study virus-induced encephalitis.
Due to its broad host range and efficient replication, it has also been developed as a vector for genes encoding vaccines and anti-cancer agents, and as a tool in gene therapy.

There are no approved vaccines or antivirals available at the moment for the prevention or treatment of SFV infection.
