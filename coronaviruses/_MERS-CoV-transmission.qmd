Bats are considered the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV while camels can be considered an intermediary host for MERS-CoV.

Direct contact with infected camels or their bodily fluids (e.g., nasal secretions, urine) may be responsible for the zoonotic transmission for a human.

Close contact with infected individuals or their respiratory secretions allows the transmission between humans.
