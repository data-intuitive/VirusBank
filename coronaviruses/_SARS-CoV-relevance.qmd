SARS-CoV caused a global outbreak in 2002-2003, affecting multiple countries and regions.

SARS was characterized by severe respiratory symptoms, leading to a high rate of hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions.

The outbreak put a strain on healthcare systems in affected areas, requiring extensive resources and rapid response measures.

The experience with SARS-CoV contributed to the establishment of global surveillance systems and preparedness strategies for handling emerging infectious diseases, including the subsequent response to SARS-CoV-2 in 2019-2020.
