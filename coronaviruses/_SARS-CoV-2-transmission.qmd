Primarily spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes.

Close contact with infected individuals within a distance of less than 1 meter (direct droplet transmission).

Can also spread via aerosols (small respiratory particles) in the air, especially in poorly ventilated indoor spaces, even at distances greater than 1 meter (airborne transmission).

Indirect contact transmission possible through touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching the face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth).

Proper hand hygiene and surface disinfection are essential to reduce indirect transmission risk.
