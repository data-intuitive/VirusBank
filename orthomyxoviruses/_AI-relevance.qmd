A very large number of wild birds have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza; the infectious pressure in the wild is thereby high. The number of infections in the poultry sector is not negligible (38 holdings since September 1, 2022, including 17 professional farms, 20 private owners and 1 zoologic park). Ferrets were also positively detected with the virus at a private keeper where an outbreak in chickens and ducks was detected. Fifteen wild foxes and three wild polecats were also found positive. This underlines the very high level of vigilance and biosecurity needed in order to avoid the introduction of the virus into its facilities.
