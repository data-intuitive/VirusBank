Influenza, commonly referred to as the flu, has the potential to induce a range of symptoms, spanning from mild discomfort to severe illness, and in some instances, fatality. Typically, flu symptoms manifest abruptly.

_It's worth emphasizing that not all individuals experiencing the flu will necessarily have a fever._
