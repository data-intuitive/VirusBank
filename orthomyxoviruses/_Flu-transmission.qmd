Influenza (Flu) primarily spreads through respiratory droplets released when infected individuals cough, sneeze, or engage in conversation. 

Additionally, it can be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces and subsequently touching one's face.

The highest level of contagion among individuals with the flu typically occurs during the initial 3-4 days of their illness.

In some cases, otherwise healthy adults can begin transmitting the virus to others as early as one day before they start showing symptoms, and this contagious period may persist for up to five to seven days after the onset of illness. 

It's important to note that certain individuals, particularly young children and those with weakened immune systems, may remain contagious for an extended duration.
