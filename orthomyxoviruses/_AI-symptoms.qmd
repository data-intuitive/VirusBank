Bird flu, also known as avian influenza or AI, is a highly contagious viral disease that affects a variety of bird species used in food production, as well as ornamental and wild birds. Avian influenza viruses induce two distinct forms of illness:

1. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI): This results from extremely virulent viruses and leads to a . high mortality rate among affected birds.

2. Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI): This is caused by viruses associated with milder respiratory symptoms, reduced egg production, and a moderate increase in mortality.

The presence of avian flu poses a significant threat to the poultry industry, resulting in substantial economic consequences. Notably, only viruses of subtypes H5 and H7 have the potential to evolve into highly pathogenic forms.

Additionally, certain avian influenza viruses are __zoonotic__, meaning they can infect humans.
