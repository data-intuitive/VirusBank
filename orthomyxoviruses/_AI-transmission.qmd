The virus is transmitted between animals, directly via saliva, nasal secretions, and feces of infected animals, or indirectly, through exposure to contaminated food, water, agricultural equipment, etc..

Trade, transport of poultry, migrations of wild birds are equally means of longer-distance transmission

Zoonotic transmission usually occurs during local farming, animal husbandry in industrial settings, i.e. direct or indirect contact during animal breeding, farming, management etc. or in animal markets in which animals are handled, especially without proper protection or care.
