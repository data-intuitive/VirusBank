Andes orthohantavirus was first identified when outbreaks of this new infection spread throughout Chile and Argentina. It is named for the Andes mountains of Chile and Argentina, where it was first discovered. 

In 1995, it was finally characterized in Argentina on the basis of specimens from a patient who had died from HPS complications, a severe consequence of infection from Andes viruses. 

As an emerging virus, it is more lethal than that of some of the other hantaviruses having a mortality rate between 40% and 50% in South America. 

By far, it has been responsible for the most recorded cases of HPS in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay combined and contributes to a large number of kidney failure cases.
