Lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV), was isolated in 1933 by Charles Armstrong during a study of an epidemic in St. Louis. Although not the cause of the outbreak, LCMV was found to be a cause of nonbacterial or aseptic meningitis.

Cases of lymphocytic choriomeningitis have been reported in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Japan, particularly during the 1900s. 

LCMV occurs now worldwide and its natural host, the rodent, has become established on all continents, except Antarctica. 

Studies have indicated that human infection of the virus occurs primarily during the fall and winter months, presumably due to the movement of mice indoors.
