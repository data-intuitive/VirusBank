The virus was first described in 1969 from a case in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria. 

Lassa fever is relatively common in West Africa including the countries of Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Ghana. 

There are about 300,000 to 500,000 cases which result in 5,000 deaths a year. 

Approximately 15%-20% of those who have required hospitalization for Lassa fever die. 

The risk of death is greater in those who are pregnant.
