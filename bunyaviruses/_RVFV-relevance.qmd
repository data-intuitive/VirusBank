Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was originally discovered as the causative agent of an outbreak of ‘enzootic hepatitis’ in 1930 near Lake Naivasha in the Rift Valley of Kenya.

The virus is now endemic throughout multiple African countries and the Arabian Peninsula. 

Outbreaks of the disease have only occurred in Africa and Arabia. Outbreaks usually occur during periods of increased rain which increase the number of mosquitoes.
