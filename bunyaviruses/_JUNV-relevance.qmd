Argentinian mammarenavirus, better known as the Junin virus or Junín virus (JUNV), is an arenavirus that causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). 

The virus took its original name from the city of Junín, around which the first cases of infection were reported, in 1958.

Since the discovery of Argentinian mammarenavirus in 1958, the geographical distribution of the pathogen, although still confined to Argentina, has expanded. At the time of discovery, Argentinian mammarenavirus was confined to an area of around 15,000 km2. At the beginning of 2000, the region with reported cases grew to around 150,000 km2.
