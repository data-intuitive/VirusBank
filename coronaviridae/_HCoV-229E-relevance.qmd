Unlike other emerging coronaviruses, Seasonal Coronaviruses are not considered novel or newly discovered; they are well-known respiratory viruses with established global distribution.

Seasonal Coronaviruses exhibit a predictable pattern of seasonality, with higher prevalence during the winter months in various regions worldwide.

While they typically cause mild respiratory infections, their global distribution and recurring nature still pose a significant public health burden due to the large number of infections each year.

Continuous monitoring and research are essential to better understand these viruses and develop strategies to mitigate their impact on vulnerable populations during peak seasons.
