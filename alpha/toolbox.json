Briefly, cells are treated with the compound at different time points prior or after the infection with the virus then cells are incubated for example until the end of one or 2 replication cycles. At the end of incubation, the intracellular and extracellular viral RNA loads at each time point are quantified by qRT-PCR to determine at which stage(s) the compound is still effective and when it loses its antiviral efficacy.",

    "description": "This technique is used for quantification of genome copies for RNA viruses in samples of interest for e.g. virus stock, clinical samples, compound-treated cells or tissues. First, a targeted region of the viral RNA is transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcriptase from total RNA. The cDNA is then used as the template for the quantitative PCR reaction where DNA binding fluorescent dye such as SYBR green or a labelled virus specific probe such as TaqManÂ® probes is used to detect the DNA amplification and hence enable quantification of the genome copies in the original samples (by including serial dilutions of a standard material with known genome copies in the same run).",
