## Symptoms

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-8}
MAYV-induced disease consists of an acute and a chronic phase. Common symptoms during the acute phase are fever, maculopapular rash, headache, dizziness, chills, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhea. More than 50% of the infected patients develop a chronic, long-term disease, characterized by a debilitating arthralgia that can persist for weeks to months.

## Transmission

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
MAYV circulates in a sylvatic cycle between non-human primates and forest canopy mosquitoes, including Mansonia sp., Psorophora sp. and Haemagogus sp. (mainly Haemagogus janthinomys). Accidental spillover to humans who are working or walking in the forests has been reported. Experimental studies have shown that the anthropophilic Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Anopheles sp. might be competent vectors of MAYV as well, which could cause a spillover to the urban cycle in the future, resulting in more human cases similar to Chikungunya virus.

## Medical relevance

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
The first MAYV strains were isolated from the blood of infected humans in Trinidad and Tobago in 1954. The virus is endemic to the tropical forests of the Amazon and was repeatedly detected in humans and mosquitoes in Latin America and the Caribbean. 

Despite being rarely fatal, MAYV infections have high socioeconomic impact due to the chronic painful incapacitating phase of the disease.

There are no approved vaccines or antivirals available at the moment for the prevention or treatment of MAYV infection.

## Toolbox

::: {.callout-note}
To be updated, should include a better and more complete description.

<ul id="tools">

```{ojs}
//| output: none

if (typeof FA === "undefined") {
