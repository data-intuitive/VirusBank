ABSTRACT = {Arthritogenic alphaviruses are responsible for a dengue-like syndrome associated with severe debilitating polyarthralgia that can persist for months or years and impact life quality. Chikungunya virus is the most well-known member of this family since it was responsible for two worldwide epidemics with millions of cases in the last 15 years. However, other arthritogenic alphaviruses that are as of yet restrained to specific territories are the cause of neglected tropical diseases: O&rsquo;nyong&rsquo;nyong virus in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mayaro virus in Latin America, and Ross River virus in Australia and the Pacific island countries and territories. This review evaluates their emerging potential in light of the current knowledge for each of them and in comparison to chikungunya virus.},

abstract = {Alphaviruses are (mainly) arthropod-borne viruses that belong to the family of the Togaviridae. Based on the disease they cause, alphaviruses are divided into an arthritogenic and an encephalitic group. Arthritogenic alphaviruses such as the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), the Ross River virus (RRV) and the Mayaro virus (MAYV) have become a serious public health concern in recent years. Epidemics are associated with high morbidity and the infections cause in many patients debilitating joint pain that can persist for months to years. The recent (2013â€“2014) introduction of CHIKV in the Americas resulted in millions of infected persons. Massive outbreaks of CHIKV and other arthritogenic alphaviruses are likely to occur in the future. Despite the worldwide (re-)emergence of these viruses, there are no antivirals or vaccines available for the treatment or prevention of infections with alphaviruses. It is therefore of utmost importance to develop antiviral strategies against these viruses. We here review the possible molecular targets in the replication cycle of these viruses for the development of antivirals. In addition, we provide an overview of the currently available in vitro systems and mouse infection models that can be used to assess the potential antiviral effect against these viruses.}
