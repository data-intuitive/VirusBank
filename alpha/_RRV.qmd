## Symptoms

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-8}
Similar to [chikungunya virus (CHIKV)](CHIKV.qmd), RRV results in rheumatic disease symptoms with febrile illness and joint pain. Some patients also can suffer from  a chronic long-term disease, characterized by a debilitating arthralgia that can persist for weeks to months.

## Transmission

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
RRV circulates in a sylvatic cycle between animal reservoirs (e.g. kangaroos and wallabies) and various mosquito species, such as those belonging to the genera of Culex, Aedes, Anopheles, and Mansonia. Accidental spillover to humans via the bite of infected mosquitoes occurs leading to outbreaks of infection.

## Medical relevance

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
CHIKV was first identified in the United Republic of Tanzania in 1952. In 2004, CHIKV re-emerged in South East Asia and the Indian ocean islands and, from there, it spread to other countries, resulting in massive outbreaks with high morbidity rates. In December 2013, local transmission of CHIKV was reported for the first time in the Americas. Since then, millions of CHIKV cases have been reported in the Caribbean region and several countries of Central and South America. Local transmission cases have been also reported in Europe (e.g. Italy and France).

Despite being rarely fatal, CHIKV infections have high socioeconomic impact due to the chronic painful incapacitating phase of the disease.
There are no approved vaccines or antivirals available at the moment for the prevention or treatment of CHIKV infection.
